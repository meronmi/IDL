Function One_of, v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6, v_7, value = val

;+
; NAME:
;	ONE_OF
; VERSION:
;	3.0
; PURPOSE:
;	Called with up to 8 variables V_0 through V_7 , ONE_OF checks which 
;	variable is defined (only one is supposed to be).
; CATEGORY:
;	Programming.
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	Result = ONE_OF( V_0 [,V_1, ... V_7] [, VALUE = VAL])
; INPUTS:
;    V_0 through V_7
;	Arbitrary, all are optional.
; OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:
;	See above.
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;    VALUE
;	Optional output, see below.
; OUTPUTS:
;	Returns the serial number (range 0 through 7) of the defined variable,
;	or -1 if none is defined.  If more than one variable is defined, ONE_OF
;	issues an error message and returns to the main level.
; OPTIONAL OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
;    VALUE
;	The name of the variable to receive the value of the single defined
;	variable, or a null string if none is defined.
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	None.
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	Currently ONE_OF is restricted to a maximum of 8 variables.  If needed,
;	the number can be increased.
; PROCEDURE:
;	Straightforward.
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	Created 15-JUL-1991 by Mati Meron.
;	Modified 30-JUL-1991 by Mati Meron.  The dependence of the original 
;	code on the EXECUTE system routine has been eliminated in order to 
;	assure compatibility with the OUTPUT routine.
;	Modified 15-NOV-1993 by Mati Meron.  Since IDL now allows for recursive
;	calls to EXECUTE, the original code has been restored.
