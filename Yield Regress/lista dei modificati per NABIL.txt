Change in the calling structure. Job_handlers are not used any more. Information are given in two txt file, one setting all the IO, one setting
the options.
Now call regress_handler from the command line using: regress_handler, full_path_of_IO_info.txt, full_path_of_OPTIONS_info.txt



New files:

regress_handler.pro (for launching the regression analysis)
predict_yield.pro (to apply the regression analysis)
read_reg_coeff.pro (reads the regression analysis results)
get_avg_max_fapar.pro
extract_RS_avg_val.pro

IO_info.txt
OPTIONS_info.txt

To be updated (remove the old one and replace it with this):
yield_regress.pro






To be removed from project:

job_handler.pro
set_io.pro
set_ptions.pro
