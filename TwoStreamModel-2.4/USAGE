All flags can appear in no specified order on the command line.

GENERAL FLAGS
	-h	Displays this message and exits
	-v	Displays the software's version number and exits
	-o 	format_string. Use format_string to select the radiative 			quantities	to be displayed as output. This is not compatible 		with the -A flag.
	-A	Display the whole set of resulting radiative quantities. This 		is not compatible with the -o flag.
	-O	(capital o) Display a line composed of the columns' tags and 		index.
For both -o and -A, refer to section OUTPUT FORMAT.


TWO-STREAM MODEL

The first three models are intended to calculate the radiative fluxes in heterogeneous vegetation canopies by using effective variable values:
--full 
Selects the generic model in [Pinty et al. 2005] with all orders of scattering activated.
--dble
Selects a model with only the first and second orders of vegetation scattering activated.
--sgle
Selects a model with only the first order of vegetation scattering activated (single scattering).

To choose a model is optional. The default is to use the full model.

The following three models are intended to calculate the radiative fluxes in homogeneous vegetation canopies but with different leaf normal distributions (LND):
--spher	Models a homogeneous canopy with a spherical 					LND.	
--plano	Models a homogeneous canopy with a planophile LND 				(mostly horizontal leaves).
--erecto	Models a homogeneous canopy with an erectophile LND 			(mostly vertical leaves).

ILLUMINATION

The model calculates the radiative fluxes in two illumination geometry, namely collimated source and isotropic source. The fraction of diffuse to total downward flux f_diff can be specified. A weighting 	is applied between the outputs in the two illumination conditions to yields the resulting fluxes:
Flux(tot) = (1 - f_diff)*Flux(collimated) + f_diff*Flux(isotropic)

-s illu   : 
Describe the illumination geometry. If illu is a numerical value, it is the zenith angle of the collimated source. Unit is degrees and it must be in ]-90,90[. However, if illu is the keyword "iso" (quotes removed), it indicates that the source is purely diffuse (f_diff is implied to 1.0)

-F f_diff   : 
set the fraction of diffuse to total downward flux. If no -F flag is used, the illumination is either purely collimated or purely isotropic, depending on the -s flag. f_diff is a numerical value that must be in ]0,1[. The -F flag can only be used if -s is present and is given a numerical value.

VEGETATION AND BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION PARAMETERS
	-l lai     : Set the True Leaf Area Index of the canopy <LAI>. Must be > 0.
	The Structure factors zeta and zeta* multiply <LAI> to yield the effective value of LAI.
	-z  zeta      : Structure factor zeta. Must be > 0.
	-z* zeta_star : Mean Structure factor zeta_star. Must be > 0.
		If both are unset, the canopy is homogeneous: zeta=zeta_star=1.
		If only one is set, both zeta and zeta_star are set to the given value.
	-g rg      : Set the background reflectance. Must be in [0,1]. If the flag is omitted, the background
		reflectance defaults to 0 (black background model).
	The effective value for the leaf Reflectance and Transmittance can be set using 2 (and no more than 2) of:
	-r rl      : Set the effective leaf Reflectance. Must be in [0,1[
	-t tl      : Set the effective leaf Transmittance. Must be in [0,1[.
	-w wl      : Set the effective leaf single scattering albedo. wl=rl+tl. Must be in [0,1[.
	-d dl      : Set the effective leaf forward-scattering efficiency. dl = rl/tl. Must be > 0.

OUTPUT FORMAT (issued on stdout only if the model completes the calculations).
	The results are all displayed on one line. The first 8 columns are a remainder
	of the input parameters to the program, in the following order.
	 (1) sun     : Sun zenith angle in degrees. (if the illumination is purely diffuse: a non-value)
	 (2) fdiff   : fraction of diffuse downward radiation.
	 (3) <lai>   : True Lai of the canopy.
	 (4) zeta    : Structure factor of the canopy for this Sun angle.
	 (5) zeta*   : Mean Structure factor of the canopy.
	 (6) rbgd    : Background reflectance.
	 (7) rleaf   : Leaf reflectance (effective value).
	 (8) tleaf   : Leaf transmittance (effective value).
	The results of the calculations are then displayed on the same line. Some (and their relative order)
	of these values can be choosen via the -o format_string sequence. format_string is a list of space (or comma)
	separated tokens, all of which composed of the % (percent) character immediatly followed by a multi-character
	identifier (e.g. %Ttot). These tokens are now listed. If no -o flag is specified, the output is the same
	as if the sequence -o "%Alb,%Abs,%Tran" had been specified. Alternatively, the -A flag makes all the
	following radiative fluxes to be displayed, in this order:
	( 9) %Alb      Total Albedo.
	(10) %Abs      Total Absorption by the vegetation canopy.
	(11) %Tran     Total Transmission to the background level.
	(12) %Alb_t1   Albedo accounting for the Black Background component.
	(13) %Alb_t2   Albedo accounting for the Black Canopy component.
	(14) %Alb_t3   Albedo accounting for the coupled canopy-background term.
	(15) %Abs_t1   Absorption by the vegetation for the Black Background component.
	(16) %Abs_t3   Absorption by the vegetation for the coupled canopy-background term.
	(17) %Tran_t1  Transmission to the background level for the Black Background conponent.
			It only accounts for the radiation collided by the vegetation.
	(18) %Tran_t2  Transmission to the background level for the Black Canopy conponent.
			This is the direct transmission through the layer.
	(19) %Tran_t3  Transmission to the background level for the coupled canopy-background term.
	(20) %Rbgd1    Albedo accounting for the radiation having hit only once the background (whether collided
			or not by the vegetation, whether upward or downward).

NOTE
	Except for -z and -z*, only the first letter of the flag is parsed
	so that -t -tl -trans -tta are all equivalent.
