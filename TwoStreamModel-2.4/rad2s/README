PURPOSE:
	This file provides general information about the rad2s package, 
	written with the C language. It implements the low-level 
	two-stream based radiation transfer routines (2s) in vegetation
	canopies.

CONTENTS:
	The rad2s package contains:

	README
		this file.
		
	black_background.c [.h]
		contains routines to calculate the reflectance,
		transmittance and absorption by a vegetation canopy
		over a totally absorbing (black) background.

        black_canopy.c [.h]
		contains the routines to calculate the reflectance
		and transmittance through a black vegetation canopy.

	gammaproc.c [.h]
		implements the low-level routines for the calculation 
		of the gamma coefficients to enter the black background 
		formulation.
       
       commonrad.h
       		macros and numerical constants.

NOTES:
	Some inline comments cite equation numbers to be found in the reference cited above (REFERENCES). 
	However, these equation numbers could be not accurate (several re-formatting of the manuscript).
	These comments will be fixed as soon as the definitive version of the article is in press.
