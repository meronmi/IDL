;     To configure the phenot software package for a particular site.

;     rc = phenot_p0()

;  Input parameters: None.

;  Output parameters: None.

;  Return values:
;     0: Normal completion.

platform = !version.os_family

;  Set the screen device and the directory separator:
IF (platform EQ 'unix') THEN BEGIN
   screen = 'X'
   dirsep = '/'
ENDIF ELSE BEGIN
   screen = 'Win'
   dirsep = '\'
ENDELSE

;  Read the initialization file for the current run and reuse the return
;  code of phenot_p0_job:
rc = phenot_p0_job()
retcode = rc

;  Report the outcome of Phase 0:
PRINT, '*** phenot_p0.pro [INFO]: Completed Phase 0.'
